Introduction
============

UniLWP.Droid is a live wallpaper (LWP) solution for Unity to run on Android. It is used in most live wallpaper apps from `FinGameWorks <https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=5201975025990666617>`_, including `Metropolis <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.justzht.metropolis>`_, `Vortex <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.justzht.vortex>`_, and `Diorama <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.justzht.lwp.diorama>`_.
