Introduction
============

UniLWP.Droid is a live wallpaper (LWP) solution for Unity to run on Android. It is used in most live wallpaper apps from `FinGameWorks <https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=5201975025990666617>`_, including `Metropolis <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.justzht.metropolis>`_, `Vortex <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.justzht.vortex>`_, and `Diorama <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.justzht.lwp.diorama>`_.

UniLWP.Droid is built with customization in mind. It works with Unity's default apk build pipeline (and therefore also works on Cloud Unity), but what makes it different from other solutions is an alternative workflow provided to deeply customize the look and bahavior of your apps through Android Studio.
